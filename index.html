    <h1>Barney Theme Song</h1>

    <p>
      Barney is a dinosaur from our imagination
      And when he's tall
      He's what we call a dinosaur sensation
    </p>

    <p>
      Barney's friends are big and small
      They come from lots of places
      After school they meet to play
      And sing with happy faces
    </p>

    <p>
      Barney shows us lots of things
      Like how to play pretend
      ABC's, and 123's
      And how to be a friend
    </p>

    <p>
      Barney comes to play with us
      Whenever we may need him
      Barney can be your friend too
      If you just make-believe him!
    </p>
